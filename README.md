## Flight Delay Analysis Project 
# Project Objective
I have developed a comprehensive project in Excel and Tableau using public datasets from Kaggle about flight delays. I performed data pre-processing and data cleansing using Excel, then visualized the data using Tableau.

# Dataset
<a href="https://github.com/viviannabila/Data-Analysis-Flight-Delay/blob/main/Airline%20Delay%20Cleaned%20(untuk%20Tableau).xlsx">Flight Delay Dataset</a>

# Question (KPIs)
- What type of delay was most prevalent in flights in the United States during the 2017–2022 period?
- Which airline contributed the most to delays?
- When did a significant spike in delays occur?
- In which region did the highest delays occur?
- Why was the contribution of security delays so small compared to other types?
- How did flight delay trends and patterns change over time?
- Dashboard interaction <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/DashboardFlightDelay_17638676088190/USFlightDelay?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">View Dashboard</a>
