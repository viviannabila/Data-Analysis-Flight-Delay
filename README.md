# Flight Delay Analysis Project 
## Project Objective
I have developed a comprehensive project in Excel and Tableau using public datasets from Kaggle about flight delays. I performed data pre-processing and data cleansing using Excel, then visualized the data using Tableau.

## Dataset
<a href="https://github.com/viviannabila/Data-Analysis-Flight-Delay/blob/main/Airline%20Delay%20Cleaned%20(untuk%20Tableau).xlsx">Flight Delay Dataset</a>

## Question (KPIs)
- What type of delay was most prevalent in flights in the United States during the 2017–2022 period?
- Which airline contributed the most to delays?
- When did a significant spike in delays occur?
- In which region did the highest delays occur?
- Why was the contribution of security delays so small compared to other types?
- How did flight delay trends and patterns change over time?
  
- Dashboard interaction <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/DashboardFlightDelay_17638676088190/USFlightDelay?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">View Dashboard</a>

## Process
-Verify data for missing values and anomalies, and reset the data.
- Ensure that the data is consistent and clean in terms of data type, data format, and values used.
- Once the Excel data is clean, upload it to Tableau.
- Create an interactive dashboard by creating a sheet for each visualization, designing the layout, adding objects and annotations, and combining all elements into a single dashboard.

## Project Insight
- The most common type of delay was Late aircraft delay, with a total of approximately 146 million delays during the 2017–2022 period.
- The airline with the largest contribution to arrival delays was Southwest Airlines Co, with a total of approximately 61 million arrival delays.
- A significant spike in delays occurred in mid-2020, specifically in April 2020, at 56.3%.
- The highest number of delays was concentrated in the city of Chicago, with a total of approximately 24 million delays.
- Security delays were small because security incidents were rare and the system was preventive.
- Trends show stability before 2020, a surge in 2020, and then a partial recovery after 2020.

## Final Conclusion
Flight delays in the US during the 2017–2022 period were dominated by internal carrier operational factors, particularly aircraft rotation delays. The highest spike occurred in 2020, with partial recovery in subsequent years. The highest delays were concentrated in Chicago with high late aircraft delays, while safety factors contributed very little. This shows that the most effective delay reduction strategy is to focus on improving airline fleet management and operational schedules.
