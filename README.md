## Flight Delay Analysis Project 
# Project Objective
I have developed a comprehensive project in Excel and Tableau using public datasets from Kaggle about flight delays. I performed data pre-processing and data cleansing using Excel, then visualized the data using Tableau.

# Dataset
<a href="https://github.com/viviannabila/Data-Analysis-Flight-Delay/blob/main/Airline%20Delay%20Cleaned%20(untuk%20Tableau).xlsx">Flight Delay Dataset</a>

# Question (KPIs)
- What was the main factor causing flight delays in the US during the 2017–2022 period?
- Which airline had the highest total delays during the observation period?
- What is the average trend in carrier delay percentage from 2017 to 2022?
- Which carrier contributed to the most delays in arrivals?
